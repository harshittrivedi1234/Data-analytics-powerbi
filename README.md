## About the Project

 Using Power BI, you can combine your data sources, create stunning visualizations, and embed your story on your website within seconds. The goal of this project is to teach  how to use raw data, monitor it, and visualize it in a form that will provide rich insights with the help of dashboards.

You will start with a set of business requirements for an example project from a client. Initially, you will connect to a data file. You'll run through the process of connecting to your data, transform it, and then build the data model. This will help you understand and determine which DAX calculations are needed to meet the business requirements. Finally, you will build out an interactive and functional report and a detailed dashboard, and publish them on PowerBI.com.
